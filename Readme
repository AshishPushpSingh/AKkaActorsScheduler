This is sample application which shows you how to create a scheduler / cron-job  in Play scala using Akka actors.

Note: Most of the classes which have been used from the scala classes are Java classes. Scala makes it very easy
by providing easy, clean and short code. But the same thing can be done in java as well using the same approach and
classes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Topics you need to understand:-
* Google Guice container
* Akka Actors
* Play Framework


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: For making it work in play you need to add the Module class to application.conf. For other frameworks you might
need to instantiate the JobModule class.

play.modules.enabled += "scala.scheduler.JobModule"

Be careful with the package structure.



Thanks,
